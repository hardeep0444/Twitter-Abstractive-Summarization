Rohit Sharma expressed his frustration at Ravindra Jadeja. Jadeja has become only the second Indian to have 5000 runs and 500 wickets. India is looking to make changes to their team in the coming years, with Yashasvi, Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz, Shubman Pant, Shreyas, Jadeja, Washington, Ashwin, Axar, Prasidh, Siraj, and Mohsin being the potential players.

Matthew Kuhnemann had an impressive performance in the India vs Australia Test cricket match, taking his first five wicket haul. Despite India's bowling and Steve Smith's captaincy, Australia was able to bowl well and India was unable to turn the match around. Ravichandran Ashwin and Jadeja were the stars of the match, leading India's domination. India is currently ranked number one in the ICC rankings and are the champions of the sport. A drone made in China intruded into Indian territory in Amritsar, Punjab and the BSF fired at it and it fell down. There has been a protest on Twitter to get some accounts banned, as the test pitches are considered to be horrible for all players. Virat Kohli and Steve Smith have yet to score a fifty in BGT2023."

It was then revealed that the award was from a fake film festival and was easily bought, which made Dada Saheb's grandson extremely upset. Agnihotri then mocked Shah Rukh Khan's movie Pathaan."
